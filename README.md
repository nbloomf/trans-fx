trans-fx
========

This is the source repository of the `trans-fx` Haskell library and its supplements.

`trans-fx` is a reimagining of `transformers` and `mtl` taking advantage of some newer features of GHC, specifically the `QuantifiedContexts` language extension. Our aim is to provide a composable, extensible, and mockable grammar of monadic effects that is efficient and easy to use.
